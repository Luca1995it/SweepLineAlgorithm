# SweepLineAlgorithm

A Python implementation of the Sweep Plane Algorithm.
The algorithm works fine if no segment is perfectly vertical, otherwise the number of intersections found could be different from the real result.

It uses a custom version of a PriorityQueue (to store the events) and a custom version of a TreeSet (to store the state segments).

Open and launch
